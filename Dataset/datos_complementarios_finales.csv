an aerodynamic stall and subsequent uncommanded roll during a one engine-inoperative takeoff flight test, which were the result of (1) Gulfstreams failure to properly develop and validate takeoff speeds for the flight tests and recognize and correct the takeoff safety speed (V2) error during previous G650 flight tests, (2) the G650 flight test teams persistent and increasingly aggressive attempts to achieve V2 speeds that were erroneously low, and (3) Gulfstreams inadequate investigation of previous G650 uncommanded roll events, which indicated that the companys estimated stall angle of attack while the airplane was in ground effect was too high. Contributing to the accident was Gulfstreams failure to effectively manage the G650 flight test program by pursuing an aggressive program schedule without ensuring that the roles and responsibilities of team members had been appropriately defined and implemented, engineering processes had received sufficient technical planning and oversight, potential hazards had been fully identified, and appropriate risk controls had been implemented and were functioning as intended."

The fuel imbalance was due to incomplete refueling and an ineffective preflight inspection by the pilot.  The imbalance was further complicated by an incorrectly assembled fuel transfer valve and motor combination.  

Contributing to the severity of the accident was the pilot's delayed decision to eject prior to exceeding the ejection seat envelope.  Also contributing to the accident was (1) the Navy's oversight environment, which did not require airman, aircraft, and risk management controls or standards expected of a commercial civil aviation operation, and (2) ATAC's organizational environment, which did not include CRM training to promote good aeronautical decision-making and ORM guidance to mitigate hazards.  Also contributing to the accident were the design features of the airplane, which were typical of its generation, including the lack of accurate fuel quantity indications, the design of the fuel transfer valve; and the maintenance program's lack of clearly documented procedures and type-specific training for the Hunter."

One large blade fragment was deflected out of the fan containment plane, which pierced and exited the inlet cowl in a benign direction.

The engine and airplane met the applicable bird and containment design standards since the engine did not catch on fire, no engine cases exhibited any penetrations, the engine was able to be shutdown normally, and the airplane damage did not impact the safe operation of the airplane or create a hazard to the persons on board."

Contributing to the accident were (1) the effect of a large structure on the gusting surface wind at the airplane's parked location, which led to turbulent gust loads on the right elevator sufficient to jam it, even though the horizontal surface wind speed was below the certification design limit and maintenance inspection criteria for the airplane, and (2) the lack of a means to enable the flight crew to detect a jammed elevator during preflight checks for the Boeing MD-83 airplane. Contributing to the survivability of the accident was the captain's timely and appropriate decision to reject the takeoff, the check airman's disciplined adherence to standard operating procedures after the captain called for the rejected takeoff, and the dimensionally compliant runway safety area where the overrun occurred.

The liner buckling resulted in airflow disruption and reduced engine performance. The engine fuel control unit attempted to compensate for the decrease in engine performance by increasing the fuel flow rate. The combustion liner damage and increased fuel flow led to incomplete combustion of the fuel injected into the combustion chamber. Unconsumed fuel then ignited downstream of the combustion chamber (delayed ignition) and resulted in high pressure turbine thermal damage, and the eventual separation of a high pressure turbine 2nd stage nozzle vane segment. The separated vane segment subsequently caused low pressure turbine case burn through and catastrophic impact damage to the high and low pressure turbine stages.

The HCF crack developed as a result of a mechanically coupled LPC stage 3 and stage 1 IBR mode excitation and blade flutter response. The excitation was driven by an acoustic tone generated by turbulent airflow passing over the 2.5 bleed valve duct cavity while the engine was operating at high speeds in specific flight conditions. A primary contributor to the failure mode was an electronic engine control (EEC) software update that changed the LPC vane schedule and increased the likelihood of LPC stage 1 IBR blade flutter onset within the engine operating range. "

Accident;2019-10-18;United States;Unalaska;Fatal;Substantial;Airplane;2.0;Peninsula AviationServices Inc.,;1.0;3.0;1.0;37.0;VMC;"The landing gear manufacturers incorrect wiring of the wheel speed transducer harnesses on the left main landing gear during overhaul. The incorrect wiring caused the antiskid system not to function as intended, resulting in the failure of the left outboard tire and a significant loss of the airplanes braking ability, which led to the runway overrun. Contributing to the accident were (1) Saabs design of the wheel speed transducer wire harnesses, which did not consider and protect against human error during maintenance; (2) the Federal Aviation Administrations lack of consideration of the runway safety area dimensions at Unalaska Airport during the authorization process that allowed the Saab 2000 to operate at the airport; and (3) the flight crewmembers inappropriate decision, due to their plan continuation bias, to land on a runway with a reported tailwind that exceeded the airplane manufacturers limit. The safety margin was further reduced because of PenAirs failure to correctly apply its company-designated pilot-in-command airport qualification policy, which allowed the accident captain to operate at one of the most challenging airports in PenAirs route system with limited experience at the airport and in the Saab 2000 airplane."
